# Homework 01 HTML CSS Git Code refactor

## Description
The aim of this project was to refactor already existing code to make it more accessible, ensure all links work correctly and improve the search engine optimization through adding to the source code and cleaning up the CSS code; reducing code repitition and making sure it follows the semantic structure of HTML without completely altering the layout of the webpage. Comments were also added to both the CSS and HTML files to ease interpetation of the code.
